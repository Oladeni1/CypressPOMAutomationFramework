## Quick Start

Running your first Cypress test suite on BrowserStack is super easy - just install our CLI, configure the test run settings and start testing. Hereâ€™s a quick start guide to help you get started.

### Step 1: Install the CLI

First, install the BrowserStack - Cypress CLI via `npm`:

```bash
# Install the BrowserStack Cypress CLI
$ npm install -g browserstack-cypress-cli
```

### Step 2: Configure

Next, set up your BrowserStack credentials and configure the browsers that you want to run your tests on. Use the `init` command to generate a sample `browserstack.json` file, or alternatively create one from scratch.

```bash
# Create a sample configuration file for configurations and capabilities
$ browserstack-cypress init
```

Fill in the `auth`, `browsers`, `run_settings` values in the `browserstack.json` file to be able to run your tests. Refer to the [configuration options](https://browserstack.com/docs/automate/cypress#configure-test-run-settings) to learn more about all the options you can use in `browserstack.json` and the possible values that you can mention.

Make sure you also specify the `npm` packages that your tests need to run using the `npm_dependencies` option in `run_settings`.

### Step 3: Run your tests

After you specify the required run settings, you can run your tests on BrowserStack:

```bash
$ browserstack-cypress run
```

After the tests are successfully submitted, you can access the test results on the [BrowserStack Automate dashboard](https://automate.browserstack.com/dashboard/v2)

To learn more about the different options the CLI supports - like running tests in parallel, running  tests on `localhost` URLs etc., refer to the [BrowserStack Cypress documentation](https://browserstack.com/docs/automate/cypress)
